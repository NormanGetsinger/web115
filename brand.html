<h1>Mr. G's Asian Kitchen</h1>

<p>
"Authentic, savory, delicious food"
</p> 

<p> 
My Brand will be an asian restaurant that serves a variety of asian food. The goal of Mr.G's 
	Asian Kitchen is to provide the highest quality asian 
food in town! Mr.G's Asian Kitchen will focus primarily on Vietnamese and Japanese
food such as Sushi, Pho, Vermicelli bowls, and Rice dishes. We want to provide the most
authentic food to people so that they can enjoy the flavors and aromas of other cultures.
Getting away from the volitality of day to day life is important, so we want to provide
an enviornment that is relaxed and pleasant so that people can have an enjoyable expereince.

The standard colors that I want to use here are red #c91104, green #05b044, 
gold #d1b904 .

Below is how the colors should be used:
</p>

<p>
<ul>
	<li>Red will be used as a background color</li>
	<li>Gold will be used as a heading color</li>
	<li>Green will be the majority of the text</li>
	
</ul>


<h2>Mr.G's Asian Kitchen demographic segmentation</h2>


	<ul>
		<li>Middle to upper middle class is the group that we will target</li>
		<li>Will try to target individuals who are most interested in sushi and Vietnamese. </li>
		<li>Also provide a bar for patrons that will have drinks like saki and other Asian inspired drinks</li>
